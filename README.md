Our data validation for 2024 utilizes standard scaling and PCA to verify not only the integrity of results, but also key performance factors. 

PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a dimensionality reduction algorithm used to attempt to reconstruct data. Essentially, this algorithm works by taking an n-greatest number of eigen components for each iteration (which indicate high variability and therefore most signifcant elements to explained behavior). Further details about this algorithm will be expanded upon in my next push.
